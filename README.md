# Ralph Loop Template

This container my template files for ralph loops.

Created from information in:

- [Ship working code while you sleep with the Ralph Wiggum technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IK18goX4X8)
- [The Ralph Wiggum Loop from 1st principles (by the creator of Ralph)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nna09dG_c0&t=2s)

## TODO

- read [Effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents).
- consider implementing [the specs as a json based prd as detailed by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)
and as [Matt Pocock does](https://youtu.be/_IK18goX4X8?si=u4Pu-jcqrjBKKNEc&t=678).
- improve the instructions to use testing such as "using browser automation
tool and do all testing as human user would". This is more important once the
ralph loop is implemented.
- Implement the ralph loop with a human in the loop.

## ./ralph

This folder container the template files generated by the LLM. To start a ralph
loop in a new project, copy the contents of this folder into your project
directory.

Currently they are only set up for single itterations, but in the future they
will be set up for ralph loops. This will require adding instructions to the
prompt to create a commit. Also, it will require setting up the loop that calls
the cli agent tool. Also, It would be good to set up an early exit as specified
by [Matt Pocock at 9:51](https://youtu.be/_IK18goX4X8?si=kOT9wDLQMldcxsya&t=591).

## Prompts

### Ralph loop setup prompt

Below is the prompt used to generate the files in the `./ralph` folder.

```
Please assist me in creating files to get started with a ralph wiggum loop.
Create the following files and folders in the ./ralph folder:

## Prompt file
Please create a prompt file with placeholder text. It should start with intructions to study the context file, the spec/README.txt, and the spec/__ (whatever sepecification we are trying to implement). It should include instructions to stop and flag with the user if it find any features that are currently in progress which the user may have assumed to be completed. Then it should contain an "IMPORTANT" section that says to create new test and to run any relevant tests. It should have instructions to implement the feature detailed in the specs file starting with the the part that makes the other parts easier or quicker. It should have instructions to update the context file with any instructions to future LLM model runs. It should have instructions to update the specs file and specs readme file (in the section of the relevant specs file) if any details are missing or incorrect. It should have instructions to update the specs file in the progress section with the details of the progress on implementing the current spec. It should have instructions to ouput <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all tasks have been complete to signal the loop to stop.

## Context file
Please create a context file. The purpose of this file is so that AI can read it and get an understanding of important parts of the code that are relevant to the current spec without having to read the whole code base. At the top leave instructions to the AI for how to use it, and include instructions that the details can be cleared out manually at clear completion points in the development cycle. The AI should append to the file in the recent changes section, not change old entries. The AI should append to this file with important information and summaries to future people or AI agents that work on this code. Other sections can be updated as required. It should include sections for:

- Recent Changes: A log of recent changes made to the codebase with dates and brief descriptions.
- Key Components: Summaries of key components or modules in the codebase, explaining their purpose
- Important Decisions: Documentation of important architectural or design decisions made during development, along with the reasoning behind them.
- Known Issues: A list of any known issues or technical debt that should be addressed in the future, but not as part of the current work.
- Future Considerations: Notes on potential future enhancements or areas for improvement that have been identified

## specs folder
please create a specs folder. 

Create an example specs markdown file and populate it with an example specifiation.

create a README in the specs folder. 

### The README File (specs/readme.md)

It should start with details about what the folder should contain. It should mention that specs files are the "pin" that prevents context rot. It doesn't tell the AI how to code; it tells the AI what the requirements are so the AI can check its own work. It should reference the example created earlier. The README.md acts as a lookup table for the AI's search tools. It should contain and entry for each spec file in the folder with the following details:
- Generative Keywords: It should contain a list of specifications with multiple descriptive "generative words" for each. For example, instead of just saying "Auth," you would list related terms like "user authentication," "login," and "identity management."
- A Direct Link: A relative path to the specific .md file so the AI can navigate directly to the source of truth.
- A One-Sentence Summary: A high-level description of what that specific module or feature does. This helps the AI quickly determine if it's looking at the right file before it commits to reading the entire document.
- Status: Whether the specification has been implemented or not, or is in progress.
- Tests: passing, failing, or NA if there are no relevant tests.
- Dependencies: Include a brief mention of dependencies (e.g., "Requires Spec X to be implemented first"), though the primary goal is to keep it a clean "lookup table".
```

Subsequent prompts:

```
Please make minimal updates to the original prompt below and files as required
to achieve the goals:

PASTE ORIGINAL PROMPT FROM ABOVE
```

##  generation prompt

```
I want to __. Please read the ./ralph/specs/README.md file, and any other
individual specs files you deem helpful, with the goal of creating a spec file
for the feature. Discuss with me to get an understanding before I give
permission to generate the spec file.
```
