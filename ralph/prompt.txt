# AI Agent Instructions - Ralph Wiggum Loop

## Initial Review
Before beginning any work, carefully study the following files in order:
1. **context.md** - Read the context file to understand recent changes, key components, and important decisions
2. **spec/README.md** - Review the specification lookup table to understand all available specs and their current status
3. **spec/[CURRENT_SPEC].md** - Read the specific specification file you have been asked to implement in its entirety

## IMPORTANT: Testing Requirements
- CREATE new tests for any new functionality you implement
- RUN all relevant tests after making changes
- ENSURE all tests pass before considering your work complete
- UPDATE test status in the spec README.md file

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Identify Dependencies**: Determine if any other specs need to be implemented first
2. **Start with Foundation**: Implement the part of the feature that makes other parts easier or quicker to build
3. **Build Incrementally**: Work through the specification systematically, testing as you go
4. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure all requirements in the spec are fully implemented

## Documentation Requirements

### Update Context File (context.md)
- APPEND important information for future LLM model runs
- Document key decisions made during implementation
- Note any architectural changes or important patterns used
- Add warnings or gotchas that future developers should know
- Do NOT modify existing recent changes entries - only append new information
- Update other sections as needed

### Update Specification Files
- **spec/[CURRENT_SPEC].md**: 
  - Update the Progress section with detailed status of implementation
  - Mark completed items with dates
  - Note any blockers or issues encountered
  - If you discover missing or incorrect details, ADD them to the spec (don't delete existing content)
  
- **spec/README.md**:
  - Update the status field for the current spec (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
  - Update the Tests field (NA → Failing → Passing)
  - If you added clarifications to the spec, ensure keywords and summary are still accurate

## Quality Checklist
Before completing your work, verify:
- [ ] All spec requirements are implemented
- [ ] New tests are created and passing
- [ ] Context file is updated with important information
- [ ] Spec file Progress section is updated
- [ ] Spec README.md status and tests are updated
- [ ] Code is properly documented
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Work Philosophy
Focus on completing one spec fully before moving to the next. Quality and completeness are more important than speed.
